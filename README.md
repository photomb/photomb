## Hi there 👋

I'm Bertrand and I propose on my GitHub all of new idea for culture and future 🔮
Maybe you wonder why the nickname of my Github is <strong>Photomb</strong> ? It'because I was a photographer in the past and I made a lot of Arts Photos during my Art Studies at Aix-en-Provence.
Nowaday, I put away my camera 📷 to take a keyboard 💻 and code the world 😎
